## Coding Task

This coding task contained two parts (plus one test):

1. A Users page, which displays all users with 3 pieces of data: username, full name, and company name.
2. A todo form, which takes in a todo title and creates a todo with id, title and completion status.
3. A Cypress test that verifies the id of a newly created todo is 201.
